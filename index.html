            <b> HTML:</b>
               The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard
            markup language for documents designed to be displayed
            in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such
            as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages 
            such as JavaScript.
               Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from 
            local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. 
               HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and
            originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

                <b>Css:</b>
               Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
                describing the presentation of a document written in a markup 
                language such as HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the
                 World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]
               CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content,
                including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility,
                 provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics,
                  enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .
                  css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .
                  css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

                <b>JavaScript:</b>
                JavaScript ,[9] often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language
                 that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[10] JavaScript is high-level,
                  often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax,
                   dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
                Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.
                [11] Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior,[12] often incorporating
                 third-party libraries.[13] Most web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.
                As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional,
                 and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text,
                  dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
